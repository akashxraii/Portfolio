        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Business Systems at Techno India University. I have a strong interest in technology and am continuously expanding my skill set.

            At the moment, I am learning various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Web Application Development, C, Kotlin, and JavaScript. I enjoy exploring new concepts in both the technical and business aspects of computer science, which allows me to build solutions with a blend of creativity and practicality.
            
            In addition to my studies, I also have a passion for writing and regularly contribute articles on topics related to technology, programming, and web development. Writing allows me to share my knowledge and help others while deepening my understanding of these subjects.
            
            I am excited to continue growing my skills, working on projects, and contributing to the tech community. Feel free to connect with me if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss ideas!</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project 1:</strong>For this project, I developed a chess game where players can play against an AI bot. I integrated Stockfish, one of the strongest open-source chess engines, to power the AI opponent, providing a challenging and dynamic gaming experience. The entire game interface was built using Pygame, a popular Python library for creating games. The project involved designing an intuitive user interface, implementing the game mechanics (such as piece movement, check, and checkmate detection), and ensuring smooth interaction with Stockfish for real-time game analysis. This project helped me enhance my skills in Python programming, AI integration, and game development while offering a fun and interactive chess-playing experience.. <a href="https://github.com/akashxraii/Ai-bot-chess.git">View Project</a></li>
